NVIDIA DLSS is constantly evolving, and is available today in over 330 released games and apps. Now, we’re unveiling NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, featuring Ray Reconstruction, our newest innovation that enhances ray tracing with AI.

NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 debuts this fall in Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, Portal with RTX, and creative apps. You’ll find full details below.

Additionally, NVIDIA DLSS 3’s AI-powered performance acceleration is coming to this fall’s biggest games, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, PAYDAY 3, and Fortnite.

Introducing NVIDIA DLSS 3.5
NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 will make your games even more beautiful, immersive and realistic with the introduction of Ray Reconstruction, a new AI-powered technique that further improves the quality of ray tracing.

To ray trace games at fast frame rates, a sample of rays are fired into a scene, and hand-tuned denoisers are used to fill in missing pixels for each lighting pass.

Each hand-tuned denoiser accumulates pixels from multiple frames to increase detail, in effect stealing rays from the past, but at the risk of introducing ghosting, removing dynamic effects, and reducing the quality of others. It also interpolates neighboring pixels, and blends this information together, but at the risk of blending away too much detailed information, or not blending enough and creating non-uniform lighting effects.

DLSS 3.5 introduces Ray Reconstruction, part of an enhanced AI-powered neural renderer that improves ray traced image quality for all GeForce RTX GPUs by replacing hand-tuned denoisers with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels in-between sampled rays.

In Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, Portal with RTX, Chaos Vantage, D5 Render, and NVIDIA Omniverse, DLSS 3.5 will noticeably improve the fidelity and realism of ray-traced effects, resolving issues introduced by hand-tuned denoisers.

Take a look at the following examples from Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty and D5 Render to see the benefits, and be sure to watch our new DLSS 3.5 videos from Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and Portal with RTX:

When DLSS 3.5 debuts in Cyberpunk 2077 and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty this September, and other games and apps this fall, GeForce RTX 40 Series users can combine Super Resolution and Frame Generation with Ray Reconstruction for breathtaking performance and image quality, while GeForce RTX 20 and 30 Series users can add Ray Reconstruction to their AI-powered arsenal alongside Super Resolution and DLAA.

Ray Reconstruction is a new option for developers to improve image quality for their ray-traced titles and is offered as part of DLSS 3.5. Rasterized games featuring DLSS 3.5 also include our latest updates to Super Resolution and DLAA, but will not benefit from Ray Reconstruction due to the lack of ray-traced effects.

For much more detail on Ray Reconstruction, please visit our NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 explainer article, and watch our Tech Talk by Bryan Catanzaro, Vice President of Applied Deep Learning Research at NVIDIA.

Portal with RTX Upgrades To DLSS 3.5 This Fall
Portal with RTX is our fully ray-traced reimagining of Valve’s classic game, featuring stunning path-traced visuals, the latest performance-accelerating NVIDIA technologies, and NVIDIA DLSS 3, which multiplied performance by 3X.


 
This fall, Portal with RTX upgrades to NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, making the game even more beautiful, immersive and realistic with the introduction of Ray Reconstruction, a new AI-powered technique that further improves the quality of ray tracing.

In Portal with RTX, textures are enhanced as Ray Reconstruction intelligently accumulates engine data and information across multiple frames to produce a more accurate and clear image. With existing rendering techniques, full ray tracing could struggle to resolve multiple photons of light bouncing against thin materials, like metal fences, or highly reflective surfaces. This could cause excessive shimmering on thin surfaces and light instability or “boiling” on reflective walls. But with DLSS 3.5’s Ray Reconstruction technology, each fence appears stable no matter how much light is illuminating the thinnest of its meshes.

Lights and reflections update faster and more accurately, too and each crevice in every room is lit with clarity, making the test chambers of Aperture Laboratories look as they would in the real world.


 
Ray Reconstruction will be available for all GeForce RTX users - get the complete lowdown in our NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 announcement article. And catch it on GeForce NOW to stream it from the cloud if you don’t have a game-ready device.

DLSS 3.5 Comes To Chaos Vantage, D5 Render & NVIDIA Omniverse
Gamers aren’t the only ones who will reap the benefits of DLSS 3.5. 3D creators often work with heavy, complex scenes, which result in noisy and inaccurate previews. This makes sharing their work with clients and collaborators difficult, and hours can be spent on final rendering to view the potential outcome.

With Ray Reconstruction, all GeForce RTX 3D creators can now view high quality, more accurate renders in their previews, expediting their workflow and improving their collaboration.

DLSS 3.5 is a major breakthrough for the real-time 3D editing experience. This fall, DLSS 3.5 will be added to Chaos Vantage, D5 Render, and NVIDIA Omniverse.

By Andrew Burnes on September 27, 2023 | Featured StoriesGeForce RTX GPUsGeForce RTX LaptopsNVIDIA Reflex
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive’s popularity has continued to increase since its release way back in 2012, and today, it remains the most played game on Steam each week, boasting over one million concurrent players.

Now, Valve has launched Counter-Strike 2, a graphical and technological update that upgrades Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to the Source 2 engine, leveraging newer graphics APIs for improved fidelity and responsiveness. NVIDIA has worked with Valve to make sure system latency, which is critical to winning, is at an absolute minimum with the addition of NVIDIA Reflex.

In competitive shooters such as Counter-Strike 2, higher FPS and lower system latency allows you to acquire targets faster, react more quickly, and increase aim precision. On a GeForce RTX 40 Series PC or laptop, your skill won’t be constrained by system latency, or frame rates.


 
Get the ultimate Counter-Strike 2 competitive experience, powered by GeForce RTX 40 Series for unbeatable performance, and NVIDIA Reflex for the lowest latency. Gamers with a compatible graphics card can enable NVIDIA Reflex in Counter-Strike 2 to reduce system latency by up to 35%.

Read on for more details. 

Ultimate Counter-Strike 2 Experience with GeForce RTX 40 Series
Counter-Strike 2 is the largest technical leap forward in Counter-Strike history, ushering in a new era for one of the most iconic first person-shooters of all time. Building upon the legendary legacy of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, this latest iteration now shines on the long anticipated Source 2 engine, promising enhanced graphical fidelity, with a physically-based rendering system producing more realistic textures and materials, dynamic lighting, reflections and more.


 
In addition to leveling up the Counter-Strike 2 world with stunningly reimagined maps, smoke grenades are now dynamic volumetric objects that interact with the environment, and react to lighting, gunfire, and explosions.  Bullets and HE grenades can push smoke to briefly clear sightlines or expand occlusion.  Smoke expands to fill spaces naturally.  And Counter-Strike 2 smoke particles work with the unified lighting system allowing for more realistic light and color.


 
Counter-Strike 2’s technical enhancements result in a more GPU-intensive experience than CS:GO, which demands the capabilities of modern GPUs to experience previous performance benchmarks (144, 240, 360 and 500 FPS).

The GeForce RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 offer the ultimate 1440p Counter-Strike 2 experience, with the GeForce RTX 4090 delivering over 400 FPS at 1440p. In comparison, the GeForce RTX 4090 is over 4.5X faster than the GTX 1080, and over 2.9X faster than the RTX 2080 in the most demanding maps.

The GeForce RTX 4070 and RTX 4070 Ti excel in Counter-Strike 2 at 1080p. The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti delivers over 360 FPS at 1080p, 2.7X faster than the GTX 1070, and almost 2X faster than the RTX 2070 in the most demanding maps.

And the GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti offer up 2.25X performance upgrades from one of Counter-Strike 2’s most popular GPUs, the GeForce GTX 1060.

At the end of the day, higher FPS will not make you a great gamer, but it will give you a better chance to win. This applies to the best Counter-Strike players in the world and those that are just getting started.


 
NVIDIA Reflex - Lowest Latency, Best Responsiveness
NVIDIA Reflex is a must-have in games, reducing system latency and improving responsiveness so your actions occur quicker. NVIDIA Reflex is now used by over 50 million players each month, is available in 9 of the top 10 competitive shooters, including Counter-Strike 2, and is activated by 90% of GeForce gamers in over 70 supported titles.


 
System Latency, often called “input lag”, is the delay between a player's action and its appearance on the screen. In games like Counter-Strike 2, even small delays can impact gameplay, making the difference between success and defeat. This delay results from the cumulative effect of several factors, including the time taken by peripherals to communicate with the PC, the PC's processing time, and the display's refresh rate. This is known as “End to End System Latency”.

There are two main types of latency:  

Network Latency: The time it takes your system to communicate with the game’s servers and services when playing online. As this cannot be controlled by the PC, and is based on the characteristics of your internet connection and your distance from the game’s servers, network latency is not measured in the system latency stat.
System Latency: The entire end-to-end response time within your gaming system. It starts with peripheral latency, the delay from your input device; progresses through Game and Render Latency, which covers CPU processing and GPU rendering known as PC Latency; and ends with Display latency, the time taken for the rendered frame to appear on your screen.
Latency impacts gameplay in several ways. For instance, you might click your mouse when your crosshair is over an opponent, but the shot might still miss due to cumulative latency. It causes a delay between what's happening in the game state and what players perceive on screen. ""Peeker’s advantage"" is also influenced by system latency—when two players are the same distance from an angle with the same network ping, the player with lower system latency will spot an opponent before their opponent sees them. Furthermore, high system latency can make aiming inconsistent and less predictable, especially in games that demand quick and precise movements. In short, the higher the system latency, the more the player’s view lags behind the game’s reality.

NVIDIA Reflex reduces latency by optimizing the rendering pipeline across the CPU and GPU, removing stalls by synchronizing each step of the pipeline. Reflex is most effective when the system is GPU-bound—or when the GPU is under high utilization—as it prevents the CPU from racing ahead of the GPU, which can cause a buildup in the render queue, increasing latency.  


GeForce RTX 40 Series with NVIDIA Reflex “On” delivers the best responsiveness in Counter-Strike 2 at sub 15ms PC latency for faster target acquisition, quicker reaction times, and the best aim precision. Gamers with compatible graphics cards can enable NVIDIA Reflex in Counter-Strike 2 to reduce system latency by up to 35%.  NVIDIA Reflex “Enabled + Boost” can further reduce latency at the cost of extra power usage and a slightly lower frame rate. In Counter-Strike 2, this setting is only recommended for gamers who prioritize lowest latency over highest frame rate.

To ensure a responsive gaming experience, it’s crucial to measure latency and determine whether your system is running well. In general, PC Latency is the most accessible metric and is the main metric that should be used when optimizing game settings, Windows settings, or any other software setting on your PC. 

There are three ways to measure PC latency in Counter-Strike 2: GeForce Experience’s Performance Overlay, the Reflex Analyzer, and FrameView. With GeForce Experience, enable the In-Game Overlay and hit ALT + R to view your PC Latency in game.

 	 
If you would like to use FrameView, here is how to get started:

Download and install FrameView

Launch FrameView (for more details, refer to the user guide)

Start Counter-Strike 2

An overlay from FrameView will be visible when the FrameView app is running.

The FrameView overlay will appear—note the baseline PCL with Reflex OFF

Enable Reflex in-game to observe the reduction in latency

For competitive players who want the best chance at victory, testing, tweaking and upgrading are the name of the game, and the Reflex Analyzer is the first tool to make this possible with complete accuracy. If you are new to measuring latency with NVIDIA Reflex Analyzer, check out our guide to get up to speed.

NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 debuts in Cyberpunk 2077 and Chaos Vantage.

NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 makes your games even more beautiful, immersive and realistic with the introduction of Ray Reconstruction, a new AI-powered technique that further enhances the quality of ray tracing. And in apps, ray-traced previews and viewports are greatly improved, enabling creators to better visualize the final result before time-consuming renders.

DLSS 3.5 is available for all GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX users; for the complete breakdown on this new technology, head to our NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 announcement article.

In other DLSS news, Lies of P, Party Animals, Warhaven and Witchfire are all launching this week with day-one DLSS support, and gamers can check out an open beta for The First Descendant, an upcoming DLSS 3-accelerated game.

In each game, GeForce RTX users will receive the definitive experience - read on for all the details.

NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 Launches Today
NVIDIA is advancing rendering technology once more with the introduction of NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, featuring Ray Reconstruction, which is a new AI model that enhances ray-traced images for intensive ray-traced games and apps.

Ray Reconstruction replaces hand-tuned denoisers, which resolve sampled rays in a scene, with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels in between sampled rays.

Hand-tuned denoisers accumulate pixels from multiple frames to increase detail, in effect stealing rays from the past, but at the risk of introducing ghosting, removing dynamic effects, and reducing the quality of others. They also interpolate neighboring pixels, and blend this information together, at the risk of blending away too much detailed information, or not blending enough, and creating non-uniform lighting effects.

Upscaling is the last stage of the ray-traced lighting pipeline, and is key to experiencing the most detailed and demanding games at fast frame rates. But with denoising removing or decreasing the quality of effects, the limitations of hand-tuned denoisers are amplified, removing fine detail (referred to as high-frequency information) that upscalers use to output a crisp, clean image.

Trained with 5X more data than DLSS 3, DLSS 3.5 recognizes different ray-traced effects to make smarter decisions about using temporal and spatial data, and to retain high frequency information for superior-quality upscaling.

Using training derived from the analysis of offline-rendered images, which require far more computational power than can be delivered during a real-time game, Ray Reconstruction recognizes lighting patterns from training data, such as that of global illumination or ambient occlusion, and recreates it in-game as you play. The results are superior to using hand-tuned denoisers.


 
In Portal with RTX, with DLSS OFF, the denoiser struggles with spatial interpolation, where it’s not blending enough pixels, creating a blotchy effect. Additionally, it’s not accumulating enough good pixels from previous frames, and the result is a boiling effect in the light. With DLSS 3.5, it recognizes certain patterns associated with reflections and keeps the image stable, accumulating accurate pixels while blending neighboring pixels to generate high quality reflections.


 
In the following scene from Cyberpunk 2077, the inaccurate headlight illumination which surrounds the car is a result of the hand-tuned denoiser pulling in inaccurate lighting effects from previous frames. DLSS 3.5 accurately generates lighting, so you can make out the beam of the headlights, and see light reflect on the curb in front of the car.

The streets of Cyberpunk 2077’s Night City are filled with reflections from rotating billboards and neon lights. By activating DLSS 3.5, their quality and clarity is vastly improved city wide:

With DLSS 3.5, we’re delivering a faster, better experience as a free upgrade, building upon the much-loved enhancements already available in your favorite games and most used apps. 

Cyberpunk 2077 Upgrades To DLSS 3.5
Cyberpunk 2077’s 2.0 update is available now with tons of enhancements, including DLSS 3.5. In Cyberpunk 2077’s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, DLSS 3.5’s new Ray Reconstruction technique improves the quality and clarity of reflections, global illumination is even more accurate, and lighting is more dynamically responsive, for an even better, more immersive, more realistic experience.

DLSS 3.5 For Creators: Chaos Vantage Upgrades Today, NVIDIA Omniverse This October
Creative platforms and applications have a wide variety of content that is difficult for traditional denoisers as they require hand-tuning per scene. As a result, when previewing content you get suboptimal image quality. With DLSS 3.5, the AI neural network is able to recognize a wide variety of scenes, producing high quality images during preview, before committing a long time for a final render.

The benefit of Ray Reconstruction is particularly noticeable while navigating the viewport, as rendering during camera movement is notoriously difficult. But Ray Reconstruction enables sharper images with significantly reduced noise while panning around a scene, improving the real-time editing experience and allowing creators to share their work with clients and collaborators.

Chaos Vantage is a popular 3D visualization tool enabling creators to explore large scenes in a fully ray-traced environment. Vantage, which is already accelerated on RTX GPUs with NVIDIA’s OptiX denoiser and NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, adds support for Ray Reconstruction to provide further enhancements to image quality, providing a massive boost for creators navigating complex scenes.


Additionally, NVIDIA Omniverse USD Composer, a fully customizable app for OpenUSD world-building that allows users to assemble, light, simulate, and render large scale scenes, will be upgrading to DLSS 3.5 in October.

If you don’t own the expansion, return to the neon lights of Night City in Cyberpunk 2077’s 2.0 update, available now, featuring support for NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 and its new Ray Reconstruction technology, enhancing the quality of full ray tracing in Cyberpunk 2077’s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode.

Press agree that Cyberpunk 2077 with DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction is an incredible leap forward for image quality and immersion:

“NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 In Cyberpunk 2077 Is Breathtaking: The Most Advanced Graphics Ever In A PC Game” - WCCFTech
“Turning on Ray Reconstruction is like a revelation.” - DigitalTrends
“It's really, really good-looking.” - PCGamer
“NVIDIA's lead in ray-tracing performance and image quality takes a massive leap forward thanks to DLSS 3.5” - TweakTown
“It didn’t take long to notice the improvement in not just the gameplay, but visuals, and performance as well thanks to DLSS 3.5.” - TechCritter
“DLSS 3.5’s Ray Reconstruction is the real deal”  - DSOGaming
Crank Ray Tracing Up To Overdrive 
Both Cyberpunk 2077 and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty feature full ray tracing in the technology preview for the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode. Full ray tracing, also known as path tracing, accurately simulates light throughout an entire scene. It is used by visual effects artists to create film and TV graphics that are indistinguishable from reality, but until the arrival of GeForce RTX GPUs with RT Cores, and the AI-powered acceleration of NVIDIA DLSS, real-time video game full ray tracing was impossible because it is extremely GPU intensive.


 
For even more info on the making of Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, check out our interview with CD PROJEKT RED

Previous techniques separately addressed ray-traced shadows, reflections and global illumination for a small number of light sources. Full ray tracing models the properties of light from a virtually unlimited number of emissive sources, delivering physically correct shadows, reflections and global illumination on all objects.

One of the most impactful additions in the technology preview of Cyberpunk 2077’s Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode is NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI), a free SDK that enables developers to closely replicate the appearance of light in scenes with numerous light sources. With RTXDI, thousands of objects can emit ray-traced light.

In Cyberpunk 2077, each neon sign, street lamp, LED billboard, car headlight, and other source of light is now ray-traced, bathing objects, walls, passing cars and pedestrians in accurate lighting.

With full ray tracing and RTXDI, now practically all light sources cast physically correct soft shadows, a feat previously unimaginable using previous approaches. Players will experience enhanced shadowing, with better depth, detail and realism.


No matter how geometrically complex a scene gets, pipes, rails, staircases, and other objects will now get proper shadows from all the shadow casting lights in their vicinity. 
Cyberpunk 2077 features a full day-night cycle. To upgrade indirect lighting from all emissive sources, including the sun and moon, Global Illumination (GI) needed to be path traced, too. Rendering techniques including Screen Space Reflections, Screen Space Ambient Occlusion, and the existing GI solutions were replaced by a single unified algorithm that delivers more accurate lighting of scenes and objects.

With the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode enabled, natural colored lighting bounces multiple times throughout Cyberpunk 2077’s world, creating more realistic indirect lighting and occlusion.

Reflections now incorporate bounced detail, too, and are rendered at full resolution, accentuating the cyberpunk aesthetic and further heightening immersion.


Full ray tracing helps to balance the diffuse and specular response of materials to the light, resulting in even more realistic reflections. Click here to view the comparison in 4K

Combined, the full ray tracing of direct and global illumination give gamers the most advanced real-time lighting seen to date in gaming, and a preview of how all games will look in the future.

Full ray tracing in Cyberpunk 2077 and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is extremely GPU intensive. For the ultimate experience we recommend GeForce RTX 40 Series and NVIDIA DLSS 3.5. Read on for more details. 

Cyberpunk 2077 Upgrades To DLSS 3.5
DLSS 3.5 is available in both Cyberpunk 2077 with the game’s 2.0 update, and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. In the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, DLSS 3.5’s new Ray Reconstruction technology enhances the quality and clarity of reflections, global illumination is even more accurate, and lighting is more dynamically responsive, for an even better, more immersive, more realistic experience.

When activated, Ray Reconstruction replaces several hand-tuned ray tracing denoisers with a new unified AI model that enhances full ray tracing, elevating image quality to new heights. In the following scene, the inaccurate headlight illumination which surrounds the car is a result of the hand-tuned denoiser pulling in inaccurate lighting effects from previous frames. DLSS 3.5 accurately generates lighting, so you can make out the beam of the headlights, and see light reflect on the curb in front of the car.

The streets of Night City are filled with reflections from rotating billboards and neon lights. By activating DLSS 3.5, their quality and clarity is enhanced city-wide:

GeForce RTX 40 Series users can combine Super Resolution and Frame Generation with Ray Reconstruction for breathtaking performance and image quality, while GeForce RTX 20 and 30 Series users can add Ray Reconstruction to their AI-powered arsenal alongside Super Resolution.

Digital Foundry DLSS 3.5 Tech Interview
In a lengthy roundtable discussion, Digital Foundry’s resident PC expert, Alex Battaglia, spoke to Bryan Catanzaro, Vice President Applied Deep Learning Research at NVIDIA, Jakub Knapik, VP Art and Global Art Director at CD Projekt RED, and NVIDIA GeForce evangelist Jacob Freeman about DLSS 3.5, the evolution of the original DLSS, the success of DLSS in the modding community, and the future of machine learning in PC graphics.


 
Those and even more topics are covered in the 1 hour discussion, so if you want even more insight into the magic of DLSS, you should definitely check it out.

Max Performance With NVIDIA DLSS 3.5
In Cyberpunk 2077 and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, replacing multiple hand-tuned denoisers with Ray Reconstruction also happens to increase performance that bit more. Get the ultimate Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty experience, using the Ray Tracing: Overdrive Mode, at over 60 FPS, with GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards. We recommend the GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 at 4K, RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4070 at 1440p, and the RTX 4060 Ti and RTX 4060 at 1080p. 
At 4K, with full ray tracing enabled, along with max settings, NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 using Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, Reflex, and Super Resolution is 4.9X faster on average than native 4K rendering, while also looking substantially more realistic and immersive:

At 2560x1440, DLSS 3.5 multiplies performance by 3X average on average, enabling 60 FPS+ gameplay on the GeForce RTX 4070 and up:

At 1920x1080, all GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers can experience Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty at the highest levels of detail thanks to a 3X average performance multiplication courtesy of Frame Generation, Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction:

C:\AI\text-generation-webui\00_my_scripts\dataset\half-life-2-rtx-remix-in-development.txt,"Announcing Half-Life 2 RTX, An RTX Remix Project Being Built By The Community
By Andrew Burnes on August 22, 2023 | Featured StoriesGamescomGeForce RTX GPUsGeForce RTX LaptopsNVIDIA DLSSNVIDIA OmniverseNVIDIA ReflexNVIDIA RTXNVIDIA RTX IONVIDIA RTX RemixPortal with RTXRay Tracing
NVIDIA RTX Remix is a free, upcoming modding platform built on NVIDIA Omniverse, designed to enable modders to create and share #RTXON mods for classic games, each with enhanced materials, full ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA RTX IO and NVIDIA Reflex.

We released Portal with RTX, a high-fidelity reimagining of Valve’s timeless classic, as an example of what’s possible with Remix. Then, we turned the tools over to community modders who remastered Portal: Prelude. Today, we’re unveiling Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project, the in-development community remaster of one of the highest-rated games of all time, Valve’s Half-Life 2.

Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project is being developed by four of Half-Life 2’s top mod teams, now working together under the banner of Orbifold Studios. Using the latest version of RTX Remix, the modders are rebuilding materials with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) properties, adding extra geometric detail via Valve’s Hammer editor, and leveraging NVIDIA technologies including full ray tracing, DLSS 3, Reflex, and RTX IO to deliver a fantastic experience for GeForce RTX gamers.

 
As with the Portal projects, almost every asset is being reconstructed in high fidelity, and full ray tracing (otherwise known as path tracing) is being leveraged to bring cutting-edge graphics to Half-Life 2. In Half-Life 2 RTX, average world textures have 8X the pixels, and assets like the suit feature 20X the geometric detail of the original game. You can now see the fabric weavings around the joints of the suit, and the interplay of plastics and metals that compose the chest, leg, and arm pieces.


Every light source bounces around the scene and casts realistic shadows, making Kleiner’s Lab feel like a real place. Orange vats cast light that illuminate dark corners in a vibrant glow, while the liquid inside refracts the entire world through it.


Props are transformed with full ray tracing, like the magnification lens on Kleiner’s desk, which used shaders in 2004 to depict a low resolution reflection of the world. Now, the magnifying glass contains a curved lens that realistically refracts light and bends every reflection, heightening immersion.


And with remastered PBR materials and textures that interact naturally with these effects, creatures like the Headcrab “Lamarr” have never looked better, pointing to how this 20 year-old classic can look like a modern game.


Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project is early in development and is a community effort looking to galvanize talented modders and artists everywhere. If you are interested in joining the project, and have significant experience with creating mods or 3D art, we encourage you to apply via the Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project website.


For more information and the latest news on Half-Life 2 RTX stay tuned to GeForce.com.

Portal with RTX Upgrades To NVIDIA DLSS 3.5
The recently released Portal: Prelude RTX used a new version of NVIDIA RTX Remix that improved performance and the quality of path tracing for older graphics cards. Later this Fall, we’re bringing those optimizations and enhancements to Portal with RTX, alongside an upgrade to NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, which introduces a new feature called Ray Reconstruction that uses AI to improve ray tracing image quality.

In Portal with RTX, textures are enhanced as Ray Reconstruction intelligently accumulates engine data and information across multiple frames to produce a more accurate and clear image. With existing rendering techniques, full ray tracing could struggle to resolve multiple photons of light bouncing against thin materials, like metal fences, or highly reflective surfaces. This could cause excessive shimmering on thin surfaces and light instability or “boiling” on reflective walls. But with DLSS 3.5’s Ray Reconstruction technology, each fence appears stable no matter how much light is illuminating the thinnest of its meshes.

Lights and reflections update faster and more accurately, too and each crevice in every room is lit with clarity, making the test chambers of Aperture Laboratories look as they would in the real world.


 
Learn more about DLSS 3.5 and Ray Reconstruction here, and head to our DLSS Games Article to see how Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and creative apps are leveraging Ray Reconstruction to further improve image quality.

By Andrew Burnes on August 22, 2023 | Featured StoriesGamescomGeForce RTX GPUsGenerative AINVIDIA ACENVIDIA DLSSNVIDIA OmniverseNVIDIA RTXRay Tracing
NVIDIA ACE is a custom AI model foundry that aims to bring intelligence to non-playable characters (NPCs) through AI-powered natural language interactions. With ACE, generic NPCs can be turned into interactive characters capable of striking up a conversation, or giving you local knowledge that leads to new quests.

At COMPUTEX 2023, we showed our ACE Kairos demo, featuring Jin the ramen shop owner, rendered in Unreal Engine 5 with RTX ON. In the months since, our team has continued to evolve ACE. Our newest advancement is the inclusion of NVIDIA NeMo SteerLM, a new technique that enables developers to customize the personality of NPCs for more emotive, realistic and memorable interactions.

Most LLMs are designed to provide only ideal responses, free of personality or emotion, as you can see by interacting with chat bots. With the SteerLM technique, however, LLMs are trained to provide responses aligned with particular attributes, ranging from humor to creativity, to toxicity, all of which can be quickly configured through simple sliders. 

 
As you can see, responses vary significantly as attributes are adjusted, and using NVIDIA NeMo SteerLM, attributes can be further modified, and new models, personalities and attributes can be added, removed or trained, enabling the creation of the perfect interactable NPC for a specific scene or location.

Emotional response isn’t the only use case that the SteerLM technique enables for games. With the SteerLM technique, developers can enable multiple characters with a single LLM by infusing personality attributes into the SteerLM model. Additionally, developers can create faction attributes to align responses to the in-game story - allowing the character to be dynamically influenced by a changing open world. 

In the demo above, we also used ElevenLabs’ TTS voice for Jin. With ACE, developers can bring their own components to the ACE pipeline, enabling a wide range of options and models. 

The SteerLM technique helps turn polite chat bots into emotive characters that will enable developers to create more immersive and realistic games. We can’t wait to show you our next ACE breakthroughs, so be sure to bookmark GeForce.com for future updates."
C:\AI\text-generation-webui\00_my_scripts\dataset\nvidia-dlss-3-5-ray-reconstruction.txt,"NVIDIA DLSS 3.5: Enhancing Ray Tracing With AI; Coming This Fall To Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, Portal with RTX & More
By Andrew Burnes on August 22, 2023 | Featured StoriesAlan Wake 2Cyberpunk 2077Frame GenerationGamescomGeForce RTX GPUsNVIDIA DLSSNVIDIA RTXPortal with RTXRay ReconstructionRay TracingSuper Resolution
NVIDIA has pioneered the AI hardware and software that is powering incredible breakthroughs across every industry. NVIDIA DLSS, one of our first major AI algorithms, was introduced five years ago and boosts performance using neural rendering, made possible by the Tensor Cores inside each GeForce RTX GPU.

Since its initial release, the AI models behind DLSS have kept learning, leading to even better results and new innovations that further multiply performance:

Today, we advance rendering technology once more with the introduction of NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, featuring Ray Reconstruction, a new AI model that creates higher quality ray-traced images for intensive ray-traced games and apps.


 
Watch our Tech Talk with VP of Applied Deep Learning Research, Bryan Catanzaro to learn how DLSS 3.5 works

Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, Portal with RTX, Chaos Vantage, D5 Render, and NVIDIA Omniverse are all adding support for NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 this fall.

See the benefits for yourself in this exclusive new look at Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, rendered with DLSS 3.5 and Full Ray Tracing:


 
""Thanks to DLSS 3.5’s smart technology, fuelled by AI rendering power, you can experience Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty’s newest location Dogtown at its very best — with sharper images, more accurate lighting, and the highest frame rates possible."" - Jakub Knapik, VP of Art, Global Art Director, CD PROJEKT RED

To appreciate the benefits of Ray Reconstruction, let’s look at how ray tracing works.

First, a game engine generates the geometry and materials of a scene, all of which have physically based attributes that affect their appearance and how light interacts with them. A sample of rays are then shot from the camera’s viewpoint, determining the properties of light sources in a scene and how light reacts when it hits materials. For instance, if rays strike a mirror, reflections are generated.

However, shooting rays for every pixel on your screen is too computationally demanding, even for offline renderers that calculate scenes over the course of several minutes or hours. So instead, ray samples must be used - these fire a handful of rays at various points across the scene for a representative sample of the scene’s lighting, reflectivity and shadowing.

The output is a noisy, speckled image with gaps, good enough to ascertain how the scene should look when ray-traced.

To fill-in the missing pixels that weren’t ray-traced, hand-tuned denoisers use two different methods, temporally accumulating pixels across multiple frames, and spatially interpolating them to blend neighboring pixels together. Through this process, the noisy raw output is converted into a ray-traced image.

These denoisers are manually-tuned and processed for each type of ray-traced lighting present in a scene, adding complexity and cost to the development process, and reducing the frame rate in highly ray-traced games where multiple denoisers operate simultaneously to maximize image quality.

Each hand-tuned denoiser accumulates pixels from multiple frames to increase detail, in effect stealing rays from the past, but at the risk of introducing ghosting, removing dynamic effects, and reducing the quality of others. It also interpolates neighboring pixels, and blends this information together, but at the risk of blending away too much detailed information, or not blending enough and creating non-uniform lighting effects.

Upscaling is the last stage of the ray-traced lighting pipeline, and is key to experiencing the most detailed and demanding games at fast frame rates. But with denoising removing or decreasing the quality of effects, the limitations of hand-tuned denoisers are amplified, removing fine detail (referred to as high-frequency information) that upscalers use to output a crisp, clean image.

The solution: NVIDIA DLSS 3.5. Our newest innovation, Ray Reconstruction, is part of an enhanced AI-powered neural renderer that improves ray-traced image quality for all GeForce RTX GPUs by replacing hand-tuned denoisers with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels in between sampled rays.

Trained with 5X more data than DLSS 3, DLSS 3.5 recognizes different ray-traced effects to make smarter decisions about using temporal and spatial data, and to retain high frequency information for superior-quality upscaling.

Trained using offline-rendered images, which require far more computational power than can be delivered during a real-time game, Ray Reconstruction recognizes lighting patterns from training data, such as that of global illumination or ambient occlusion, and recreates it in-game as you play. The results are superior to using hand-tuned denoisers.

In Portal with RTX, with DLSS OFF, the denoiser struggles with spatial interpolation, where it’s not blending enough pixels, creating a blotchy effect. Additionally, it’s not accumulating enough good pixels from previous frames, and the result is a boiling effect in the light. With DLSS 3.5, it recognizes certain patterns associated with reflections and keeps the image stable, accumulating accurate pixels while blending neighboring pixels to generate high quality reflections.


 
In the following scene from Cyberpunk 2077, the inaccurate headlight illumination which surrounds the car is a result of the hand-tuned denoiser pulling in inaccurate lighting effects from previous frames. DLSS 3.5 accurately generates lighting, so you can make out the beam of the headlights, and see light reflect on the curb in front of the car.

The streets of Cyberpunk 2077’s Night City are filled with reflections from rotating billboards and neon lights. By activating DLSS 3.5, their quality and clarity is vastly improved city wide:

Creative applications have a wide variety of content that are difficult for traditional denoisers as they require hand-tuning per scene. As a result, when previewing content you get suboptimal image quality. With DLSS 3.5, the AI neural network is able to recognize a wide variety of scenes, producing high quality images during preview and before committing hours to a final render. D5 Render, an industry-leading app for architects and designers, will be available with DLSS 3.5 this fall.

“The integration of DLSS Ray Reconstruction with D5 Render marks our third technical collaboration with NVIDIA, following DLSS SR and FG, which further enhances the image quality of D5 Render's real-time rendering capabilities. We look forward to exploring more possibilities with NVIDIA in the future.” - Jessie Huang, VP, Head of Marketing, D5 Render

With DLSS 3.5, we’re delivering a faster, better experience as a free upgrade, building upon the much-loved enhancements already available in your favorite games.

Thanks to RTX, you effectively have the power of 2 computers in your PC or laptop - the first, an NVIDIA supercomputer that trains the DLSS AI model with billions of data points, to boost performance and image quality. And the second, your GeForce RTX graphics card, with dedicated tensor cores to execute the AI model in real-time, plus specialized RT Cores, innovations such as Shader Execution Reordering, and the raw power of each RTX GPU, delivering best-in-class ray tracing.

In Cyberpunk 2077, the beautiful full ray tracing delivered by the Overdrive Mode could not be achieved smoothly without the power of AI. DLSS Super Resolution (SR), reconstructs the 4K image from a lower resolution input, delivering a dramatic performance boost and great image quality. 

To further increase performance in the most demanding, action-packed moments, we enable DLSS Frame Generation (FG) on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, which analyzes sequential frames to create additional frames to further increase smoothness.

And now, NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 further improves image quality for ray-traced effects by replacing multiple hand-tuned denoisers with Ray Reconstruction (RR).


 
Combining Super Resolution, Frame Generation and Ray Reconstruction, DLSS 3.5 multiplies Cyberpunk 2077 frame rates by a total of 5X compared to native 4K DLSS OFF rendering. 

Note that games with multiple ray-traced effects may have several denoisers that are replaced by the single Ray Reconstruction neural network. In these cases, Ray Reconstruction can also offer a performance boost. In titles with less intensive ray tracing and fewer denoisers, Ray Reconstruction improves image quality though may have a slight performance cost.

GeForce RTX 40 Series users can combine Super Resolution and Frame Generation with Ray Reconstruction for breathtaking performance and image quality, while GeForce RTX 20 and 30 Series users can add Ray Reconstruction to their AI-powered arsenal alongside Super Resolution and DLAA.

Ray Reconstruction is a new option for developers to improve image quality for their ray-traced titles and is offered as part of DLSS 3.5. Rasterized games featuring DLSS 3.5 also include our latest updates to Super Resolution and DLAA, but will not benefit from Ray Reconstruction due to the lack of ray-traced effects.

DLSS 3.5 Arrives This Fall In Leading Games & Apps

C:\AI\text-generation-webui\00_my_scripts\dataset\portal-prelude-rtx-available-now-for-free.txt,"Portal: Prelude RTX Available Today - A Free RTX Remix Mod Featuring Full Ray Tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 3 & NVIDIA RTX IO
By Andrew Burnes on July 18, 2023 | Featured StoriesGeForce RTX GPUsGeForce RTX LaptopsNVIDIA DLSSNVIDIA OmniverseNVIDIA ReflexNVIDIA RTXNVIDIA RTX IONVIDIA RTX RemixPortal with RTXRay Tracing
Portal remains a timeless classic; in December we released Portal with RTX, a fully ray-traced reimagining of Valve’s award winning game, which used the performance multiplication of NVIDIA DLSS 3 to power the most realistic path-traced lighting ever seen in a real-time game.

Portal with RTX was created using NVIDIA RTX Remix, a free, upcoming modding platform built on NVIDIA Omniverse, which enables modders to quickly create and share #RTXON mods for classic games, each with enhanced materials, full ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 3, and NVIDIA Reflex.

Now, RTX Remix has been used to remaster Portal: Prelude, the highest rated Portal mod, the 2008 Portal ModDB winner, and #3 overall Player’s Choice mod of 2008. Created by Nicolas “NykO18” Grevet and others, Portal: Prelude is an unofficial Portal prequel, set before the time of GLaDOS, featuring a new extremely challenging 8-10 hour campaign composed of 19 new test chambers, new advanced gameplay mechanics, a fully voiced story with NPCs, and a whole lot more.

Portal: Prelude RTX is available today to download from Steam, for free!


 
Portal: Prelude RTX is remastered with full ray tracing (also known as path tracing), DLSS 3, Reflex and the newly-launched NVIDIA RTX IO to deliver an even more immersive experience for gamers. It also features hundreds of new, fully upgraded materials and assets from David “Kralich” Driver-Gomm and Valerios “Fearell_Val” Tsoumpas, new voice acting by Jack “Amicus” McDade and Colin “SordidSpectacle” Zachariasen, and gameplay improvements from Nicolas. Portal: Prelude RTX is the definitive way to play the award winning mod.

Introducing Portal: Prelude RTX
If you’ve played Portal with RTX, you already know about the game’s immersive fully ray-traced (path traced) lighting, its remade materials and models, and its incredible visuals that offer a preview of how all games will look in the future. 

Portal: Prelude RTX is even more spectacular. And its technology even more advanced.

During the course of Portal: Prelude’s story, players will encounter extremely challenging, advanced test chambers with more varied sights that with the power of RTX could well drop your jaw. Multiple layers of glass refract light, players move from complete darkness to bright locations, and dangerous hazards like particle disintegrators illuminate the world in deadly light, leveraging RTX to create memorable moments.

200 new materials and textures, and 100 new models mesh perfectly with Portal with RTX’s remade assets, adding extra variety to test chambers and challenges. And more advanced geometry -that pushed the boundaries of the Source engine in 2008- enables more varied and aesthetically interesting uses of light and shadow. For Portal: Prelude RTX, geometry was updated and upgraded in standard Half-Life Engine tools (Valve Hammer Editor), before being imported and automatically supported by RTX Remix, enabling fast iteration and development. Ultimately, this gorgeous remaster was created by a team of five in eight short months.


Portal: Prelude’s inclusion of NPC characters posed new challenges, requiring the development of an exciting feature for RTX Remix: full support for skinned characters. Now, in any game with GPU skinning, Remix enables modders to add more than 100 times the polygonal detail to characters, in addition to high fidelity PBR textures, with minimal performance costs. Essentially, characters and animated/skinned props can be enhanced in the same way as any object in RTX Remix, benefiting all future RTX mods. Or in other words, RTX Remix is revolutionizing character replacements and upgrades in the same way it revolutionized asset replacement.


For Portal: Prelude RTX and future NVIDIA RTX Remix mods, the NVIDIA RTX Path Tracing SDK has been enhanced, improving denoiser performance and quality, which is particularly beneficial at lower resolutions, enabling gamers with older GeForce RTX GPUs to have a better experience.

Shader Execution Reordering (SER) dynamically reorganizes inefficient ray tracing workloads into considerably more efficient ones, further accelerating GeForce RTX 40 Series performance.

Opacity Micro Meshes (OMM) increase real-time performance and memory compression for complex geometry, further accelerating GeForce RTX 40 Series ray tracing performance, and with new CPU optimizations debuting in Portal: Prelude RTX, players receive even faster performance.

And of course, NVIDIA DLSS 3 and NVIDIA Reflex have both been upgraded to their newest versions for improved performance, even better image quality, and more responsive gameplay.


All of the enhancements, additions and improvements created for Portal: Prelude RTX will be incorporated into NVIDIA RTX Remix, benefitting all modders, and enabling superior updates to classic games. In the near future, NVIDIA will begin sharing early access versions of RTX Remix with select modders to further refine the creator toolkit and runtime ahead of its official release later this year. Stay tuned for updates.

For more, go behind the scenes in the making of Portal: Prelude RTX using RTX Remix this week In the NVIDIA Studio.

NVIDIA RTX IO Makes Its Debut, Accelerating Texture Loading Times & Reducing File Sizes
Rapid loading and smooth navigation through endless open worlds has long been a goal of gamers and developers alike. Even with the incredible performance of NVMe SSDs, this goal has remained out of reach. Modern game engines have exceeded the capability of traditional storage APIs; a new generation of Input/Output (IO) architecture is needed.

Enter NVIDIA RTX IO, enabling fast GPU-based loading and game asset decompression, massively accelerating IO performance compared to hard drives and traditional storage APIs. NVIDIA RTX IO leverages GPU decompression for smaller data packages, enabling faster texture load times and lower CPU utilization, and allows developers to create a new generation of games with massive highly detailed worlds. 

NVIDIA RTX IO makes its debut alongside the free Portal: Prelude RTX mod today, and will also feature in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, launching July 26th.

In Portal: Prelude RTX, NVIDIA RTX IO is always on (you don’t need to toggle it in a menu) and it enables much faster texture load time, minimizing asset pop-in:


 

NVIDIA RTX IO also lowers Portal: Prelude RTX’s texture package install size by 44%, enabling gamers to enjoy nearly 32 GB of 4K textures loaded with lossless detail, while only taking up 18 GB of storage space. When the RTX Remix creator toolkit is released, every modder will be able to count on RTX IO to enable them to stay true to their artistic vision, while keeping within the file size restrictions of popular modding sites.

Learn more about NVIDIA RTX IO in our launch article.

NVIDIA DLSS 3 Multiplies Performance By Up To 5X
Portal: Prelude RTX’s full ray tracing is beautiful but demanding, just like Portal with RTX. To experience Portal: Prelude RTX at Ultra settings with path-traced ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 3 and a powerful GeForce RTX GPU are recommended.

Using NVIDIA DLSS 3, GeForce RTX 4080 and 4090 users will see performance multiply by 5X on average at 4K with max settings, delivering 80 FPS+ gameplay, for the definitive experience:

At 2560x1440, owners of the GeForce RTX 4070, and faster GPUs, can enjoy 80+ FPS gameplay at the Ultra Preset, which maxes out every setting. With DLSS 3 enabled, performance is multiplied by 4.4X on average.

At 1920x1080, the resolution of choice for over 70% of Steam gamers, the GeForce RTX 4060 sees a 3.3X DLSS 3 frame rate multiplication when playing at the High preset.

On GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops, DLSS 3 provides a 3.2X average boost to performance at 1920x1080, enabling many laptop configurations to play at over 60 FPS, and allowing high end models to exceed 120 FPS!

At 1440p, powerful GeForce RTX 4080 and 4090 laptops receive a 4.3X average performance multiplier, enabling Ultra Preset gameplay at well over 60 FPS:

Like Portal with RTX, Portal: Prelude RTX is fully ray traced, meaning it is very GPU intensive. Before playing Portal: Prelude RTX, please ensure your system matches or exceeds the requirements for CPU and RAM, for the best possible experience:

For GPUs outside the minimum spec, and between minimum and recommended (i.e. some GeForce RTX 20 and 30 Series GPUs), the easiest path to better performance is to use GeForce Experience. Simply download our latest Game Ready Driver, locate Portal: Prelude RTX in the list of detected games, and click “Optimize” to automatically configure the best combination of image quality and performance settings for your GeForce RTX 20 or 30 Series GPU.

Based on our testing, GeForce RTX 2060 users can play at over 30 FPS+ at the Low Preset using DLSS Ultra Performance Mode, while GeForce RTX 3080 users can run at 60 FPS or more at 1920x1080 using the High Preset and DLSS Quality Mode.

If you prefer to configure settings manually, we have prepared a recommended graphic settings chart to help guide you to higher frame rates at 1080p, 1440p, and 4K:

To adjust these settings in-game, press Alt-X to open the Remix graphics window

Please note, performance will vary depending on your system configuration, and some options may reduce visual quality, though these settings do target a smooth 60 FPS experience. To adjust these settings, remember to press Alt-X to use the Remix graphics settings window.

Coming soon, those without a GeForce RTX GPU can stream it on GeForce NOW without worrying about system specs or download times. Upgrade to an Ultimate membership for the power of an RTX 4080 gaming rig in the cloud and crank those settings up.

The Best Responsiveness With NVIDIA Reflex
As NVIDIA DLSS revolutionized scaling and performance, NVIDIA Reflex has revolutionized low latency gaming, giving multiplayer gamers a competitive advantage, and making single-player games incredibly responsive.

Help the duo take on an evil emperor from another reality as you jump between action-packed worlds and beyond in this spectacular action-adventure-platformer, developed by acclaimed studio Insomniac Games, and brought to PC by Nixxes Software.


 
GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards and laptops can multiply performance using NVIDIA DLSS 3, while GeForce RTX 20 and 30 Series users can accelerate frame rates with NVIDIA DLSS 2. All GeForce RTX gamers can maximize image quality with NVIDIA DLAA, for the highest possible picture quality. And GeForce GTX 900 Series and newer gamers can make Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart gameplay even more responsive with NVIDIA Reflex.

Through a process detailed in full in our DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation to reconstruct 7/8ths of the displayed pixels, accelerating performance significantly.


 
In GPU-limited games, DLSS 2 Super Resolution technology can increase your frame rates by up to 2X. With DLSS 3, we can boost them by up to 4X (compared to brute-force rendering) in fully ray-traced worlds.

Certain games make extensive use of the CPU which can limit performance. DLSS 3 operates on the GPU, bypassing CPU bottlenecks and boosting frame rates.

DLSS 3 games are backwards compatible with DLSS 2 technology - developers simply integrate DLSS 3, and DLSS 2, also known as DLSS Super Resolution, is supported by default. Additionally, integrations of DLSS 3 also include NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency for all GeForce RTX users, making games more responsive.

Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart also features ray-traced reflections with a variety of quality levels to choose from, as well as newly added ray-traced shadows, for natural light in outdoor areas. Gamers with GeForce RTX GPUs can enjoy these at the highest frame rates thanks to their dedicated ray tracing cores that greatly accelerate ray tracing performance.

In December we released Portal with RTX, a fully ray-traced reimagining of Valve’s award winning game, which used the performance multiplication of NVIDIA DLSS 3 to power the most realistic path-traced lighting ever seen in a real-time game. Portal with RTX was created using NVIDIA RTX Remix, a free, upcoming modding platform built on NVIDIA Omniverse, which enables modders to quickly create and share #RTXON mods for classic games, each with enhanced materials, full ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 3, and NVIDIA Reflex.

In 2008, Portal: Prelude was released and to this day remains the highest rated Portal mod. Created by Nicolas “NykO18” Grevet and others, Portal: Prelude is an unofficial Portal prequel, set before the time of GLaDOS, featuring a new extremely challenging 8-10 hour campaign composed of 19 new test chambers, new advanced gameplay mechanics, a fully voiced story with NPCs, and a whole lot more.

Having previously retired from the modding community in 2011, Nicolas has returned to remaster Portal: Prelude using NVIDIA RTX Remix, with the assistance of David “Kralich” Driver-Gomm, Valerios “Fearell_Val” Tsoumpas, Jack “Amicus” McDade, and Colin “SordidSpectacle” Zachariasen.

Using Portal with RTX as a foundation, the entirety of Portal: Prelude has been remastered with full ray tracing (also known as path tracing) and upgraded hi-res materials, new voice acting, and improved gameplay. When playing, GeForce RTX gamers will enjoy the definitive experience, with performance multiplied by up to 5X with NVIDIA DLSS 3, improved responsiveness courtesy of NVIDIA Reflex, and super fast texture loading thanks to the newly-launched NVIDIA RTX IO. If you haven’t done so already, download Portal: Prelude RTX from Steam; it’s free to everyone who owns Portal.


 
To bring Portal: Prelude RTX to life Nicolas and David worked closely with NVIDIA, as elements of Portal: Prelude necessitated the addition of new RTX Remix features to ensure every single aspect was remastered. To learn more about RTX Remix’s additions and improvements we spoke to NVIDIA’s Nyle Usmani, Product Manager for RTX Remix, and to discover more about the creation of Portal: Prelude and the Portal: Prelude RTX remaster, we chatted with Nicolas and David.

""When I was able to get my hands on a pre-alpha early version of RTX Remix, I was honestly floored."" - Nicolas “NykO18” Grevet

NVIDIA will soon begin sharing early access versions of RTX Remix with select modders to further refine the creator toolkit and runtime ahead of its official release later this year. Nicolas and the team’s feedback has been invaluable, and has helped make RTX Remix even better. Stay tuned for further details, and be sure to join the unofficial NVIDIA RTX Remix Discord server if you’re interested in using Remix to remaster classic games.

Thanks for chatting, Nyle; why did NVIDIA and the Lightspeed development team want to remaster or help remaster a classic Portal mod?

Nyle Usmani, NVIDIA Product Manager: As the developers of RTX Remix we knew the intricacies of the tool, and how everything worked. We built Portal With RTX, which proved to us that the tool was powerful. But it’s different for Lightspeed Studios to build a game with a mod tool, versus having actual modders get their hands on the tool instead. So we thought up this collaboration where we could give early access to the RTX Remix creator toolkit to talented modders, and get feedback on how well it functions in the real world. Additionally, we had thousands of remastered Portal assets from our collaboration with Valve, which made Portal based mods a logical step.

As fans of Portal, many of us knew about Portal: Prelude, the highest rated Portal mod ever made, so we reached out to its lead developer, Nicolas Grevet to see if he would leave modder-retirement and remaster his classic. Simultaneously, we contacted prominent Source modder, David Driver-Gomm, to join the project to help create beautiful new assets. I’d say they hit a homerun–from the breathtaking visuals, the voice acting, the new gameplay–the end result is just incredible!

The NVIDIA Lightspeed team released Portal with RTX to critical acclaim in December. What did you learn from the launch, and how has that helped improve RTX Remix?

Nyle: Portal with RTX and RTX Remix as a whole are breaking new ground. When you play Portal With RTX, you’re actually playing the original Portal but the visuals are passing through a Vulkan renderer. It’s incredibly unusual to have an old school game engine pass visuals through a different renderer–especially one that enables path tracing, and can substitute the old game assets with gorgeous modern 4K versions in real time. It is a miracle that it looks and plays so well, but it’s also the first of its kind with much room for improvement.

One of the first things we focused on improving was the runtime, and its stability with substituting assets at playback. Between a more stable replacement system, and the development of RTX IO, which increases how quickly assets load in, players will notice that assets appear in the highest quality near instantaneously, and are incredibly stable in the scene. Furthermore, we made sweeping CPU and GPU performance optimizations that should enable more hardware to experience path tracing in all of its glory.

As work progressed on Portal: Prelude RTX, what changes and improvements were required to successfully remaster the original mod?

Nyle: In terms of scope, Portal: Prelude builds on the original Portal, with larger, more complex levels, and even a number of NPCs that populate its world. As a result, we had a lot of optimizations we had to make to RTX Remix to ensure the RTX remaster ran smoothly. One such feature is support for replacing the meshes of skinned characters.

For Portal with RTX, RTX Remix could not modify meshes of skinned characters, and as a result we had to add polygonal detail to the meshes via classic Source mods. We hit the limit of what source modding could do pretty quickly, and when the modders attempted the same process in Portal: Prelude RTX, it ended up being prohibitively expensive for the CPU and GPU.

We went to work, and found a way to enable entire mesh replacements for skinned assets with practically no limits or performance overhead. When the RTX Remix creator toolkit releases, modders will be able to make characters 100s of times more polygonally detailed with little to no additional cost, which will be a boon to any RTX Remix mod.


Portal: Prelude RTX’s creation took roughly 8 months to complete - how much assistance from NVIDIA was required? How has this helped improve RTX Remix, and is the remastering workflow now faster and easier for modders?

Nyle: We primarily see our role as enabling talented modders like David and Nicolas, rather than creating content ourselves. Since Portal: Prelude RTX was the first time the RTX Remix creator toolkit was being used in the wild, we worked closely with the team to provide technical support, take in feedback to improve the toolkit, and provide tips on how to work within a path traced model. The feedback we got was crucial, as it enabled us to make changes that sped up modder workflows immensely.

""The RTX Remix tool itself is insanely powerful and almost comes across as magic to me."" - Nicolas “NykO18” Grevet

For example, the modders frequently exported the mod to view their new assets, and get a sense of how they looked in-game. We were hearing that the export process to view changes was taking a lot of time. So we re-architected the modder workflow to basically remove the export process entirely. There isn’t really a final export step anymore–instead, the moment you ingest assets or make a change in your mod, the mod and the corresponding files update. What this means for modders is if you have the game open alongside the tool, every change you make in the creator toolkit will appear in the game instantaneously.

Portal: Prelude RTX includes the world’s first integration of our new NVIDIA RTX IO GPU-accelerated storage technology. How does this benefit Portal: Prelude RTX and future RTX Remix mods?

Nyle: For Portal: Prelude RTX, we’ve seen texture load times speed up by 5X and the total storage assets take up has dropped by 44%.

RTX IO provides additional  value to modders. Most modders have no asset decompression system they can turn to for their mods, meaning when a modder is looking to stay within a file size budget, all they can do is lower the quality of their assets.

With RTX IO, you can stuff your mod chock full of gorgeous detailed assets with physically accurate materials, losslessly compress them, and then decompress them at playback, executing on your artistic vision without compromises. It will also enable modders to navigate file size restrictions that are commonplace with various mod sites.

Have other NVIDIA technologies been further refined for the release of Portal: Prelude RTX, and will those also benefit future RTX Remix mods?

Nyle: For Portal: Prelude RTX and future NVIDIA RTX Remix mods, the NVIDIA RTX Path Tracing SDK has been enhanced, improving denoiser performance and quality, which is particularly beneficial at lower resolutions, enabling gamers with older GeForce RTX GPUs to have a better experience.

Shader Execution Reordering (SER) dynamically reorganizes inefficient ray tracing workloads into considerably more efficient ones, further accelerating GeForce RTX 40 Series performance. In Portal: Prelude RTX we’ve made GPU performance optimizations to how SER is implemented.

Opacity Micro Meshes (OMM) increase real-time performance and memory compression for complex geometry, further accelerating ray tracing performance on the GeForce RTX 40 Series, and with new CPU optimizations debuting in Portal: Prelude RTX, players receive even faster performance.

And we’ve made NVIDIA DLSS 3 and NVIDIA Reflex optimizations for improved performance, even better image quality, and more responsive gameplay.

All of this will transfer to RTX Remix, and any future developments or enhancements will also be incorporated into RTX Remix, ensuring all mods are using the latest and greatest technologies to give GeForce RTX gamers the definitive experience.

What’s next for NVIDIA RTX Remix? What new features are you working on? And are you working with any other modders to remaster classic mods? Give us the details, Nyle!

Nyle: We’ve been so immensely pleased with our collaboration with Nicolas and David, and the game honestly floors us. Portal: Prelude RTX has benefitted us, the gamers, and the RTX Remix tool. As for  future collaborations–who knows!

To keep up to date on everything we are doing with RTX Remix, I always recommend people check out our roadmap.

And if you are interested in other RTX Remix mods (or are a modder interested in RTX Remix), I highly encourage you to check out the “RTX Remix Showcase” community-run Discord. There are over 5000 people there doing incredible things with the RTX Remix runtime, and we always have our team active there as well.

---------------

Thanks for taking the time to speak with us, Nicolas and David; when did you start modding, and what have you worked on?

Nicolas “NykO18” Grevet: I started modding when Half-Life 1 came out with the Worldcraft 2 editor back in 1998 or 1999. I was 13 back then, and it was a struggle to find any tutorials in French about how to do anything with the tool. I mostly worked on small maps and little projects for years, on Half-Life 1, Team Fortress 1, then Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source, etc.

In 2008, I launched this large project called Portal: Prelude, which was much more than just “mapping” - it was a fully featured game that required roughly a year of work. It was a little clumsy, but the timing was right: it followed the release of Portal, and plugged a gap before the release of Portal 2. It had a very polarizing but successful launch. After that, I worked on an additional large project by producing a full-length Left 4 Dead campaign named ‘I Hate Mountains’ with some friends, and retired from the field entirely in 2011.

David “Kralich” Driver-Gomm: I started modding in 2014, creating addons for Garry’s Mod, where I developed my knowledge in the Source Engine. In 2018 I started my primary mod project, Raising the Bar: Redux, as a Half-Life 2 cut content restoration mod, and it continues strong to this day. On the side I’ve worked on a variety of other Source mods, such as being the lead asset creator on Entropy Zero 2 and releasing my own side projects like Goreagulation. Beyond that, I like to try and mod games with either very little or no serious modding support and create new communities around them - most notably, I helped construct a community around Bionicle Heroes, which now has a few dozen mods and reasonable activity today.

What inspires you to mod?

Nicolas: The idea of being able to create 3D environments you could play into, and for which your imagination was basically the limit, was definitely the appeal of modding for me. I spent way more time goofing around in the levels I was building with my friends than I was spending building them. It was a good excuse for us to play stuff together and have fun. It definitely allowed me to create life-long relationships with some fellow modders that I consider great friends to this day.

David: Modding allows me to revisit games I have a sentimental attachment to and add to their legacy. For Half-Life 2, it’s just such a powerful and versatile platform for creation that, with my current expertise in the engine, means I can create just about anything I can come to mind with. The creative problem solving inherent to modding - working out how to turn a foundation into something else - is really rewarding, and telling new stories with familiar content helps expand the universes I love. Modding is also a way I can make up for the shortcomings of a game, like expanding the combat sandbox or making more detailed levels, and in the case of much older and more obscure games, it lets me reach out to other enthusiasts for rewarding recollections of the past. I’ve always enjoyed tackling a problem and hitting my head against it until it breaks in, and modding is full of it, for better or worse!

What's something about your content modding journey you’ve really enjoyed or were surprised by? 

Nicolas: When I started getting myself involved in more serious projects like Portal: Prelude and then I Hate Mountains, I didn’t realize how much the skills required to lead such projects would transfer to a real job. I definitely landed my first few jobs in my twenties surfing on the popularity and skillset acquired while handling these projects. Modding forces you to wear many hats: you have to be a level designer, a 2D artist, a scripter, a writer, a web developer, a PR person, a release manager, a QA analyst, and so much more. It teaches you resiliency and adaptability.

David: The greatest joy of modding on Raising the Bar: Redux was bringing together a number of specialists and talented individuals who, put together, can achieve things not possible alone. Team building and bringing people together is the greatest reward modding can provide for me, and seeing the collective talent of hobbyists and passionate creators at work is something I’ve never seen in any other context or any other field. Everyone wants to be there, wants to be a part of the collective whole and produce something not for money or personal gain, but for the love of creating, and in that environment there really is nothing else out there like that.

What tools do you use for modding? What are your favorites?

Nicolas: Back then, in 2010 and before, there weren't that many tools available to modders. If you had a level editor, a trusty image editor, and a text editor, you were basically set. These days, working on Portal: Prelude RTX with NVIDIA folks and David Driver-Gomm definitely opened my eyes to how much easier, and at the same time so much more complicated everything has become. Tools like Adobe Substance 3D and the Omniverse toolkit from NVIDIA really blew my mind after years of inactivity in this field. It felt like being a kid again, witnessing magic tools you can’t quite figure out the inner workings of.

David: Every Source level designer has a love/hate relationship with ol’ Hammer (Valve’s Hammer Editor, more informally known as Hammer, is the primary tool used for Source modding), but the power it gives you once you truly understand how to use map logic and how to play by its limitations is immense and means you can really push your creative vision to the max. I also use Blender as my primary 3D modeling tool as I find it’s plugin support and community focus makes it incredibly versatile; if there’s a 3D format out there, chances are someone has written a plugin for it, and that makes it very easy to move from game to game and keep the same workflow.

What’s the story behind the creation of the Portal: Prelude mod? When and why did you choose to make an unofficial prequel to Portal?

Nicolas: In January 2008, I was looking for a new project. Portal had been out for four months, and no one had done anything really serious around it. I was a part of a lot of communities and followed a lot of independent releases, but no mod and no serious story arcs were being released. This is why I decided to launch this project.

Originally, the project was rather insignificant. It was not supposed to be a modification of the game, but just a succession of test chambers, without any real logic between them. I had no goal, I was just making maps as I saw it. And finally, when I reached a dozen test chambers, I realized that it would be a shame to waste all this work by only releasing yet another map pack without any real backstory. This is where I began to write a whole new story and decided to follow the famous belief that prequels were somewhat popular at that time.

My goal was to make it a personal project, without telling anyone about it. I wanted to surprise everyone by releasing a quality, polished, and fully finished game, offering roughly the same amount of playtime as Portal. As months passed, I had more and more difficulty working on it regularly. In real life, I was both a student and an employee, and that didn't leave me with a lot of time to work on the game. This is where I decided to ask for some help, mainly from Jérémy ""Capitaine Mousse"" Barbe, who helped me by making four of the nineteen test chambers while I was working on the final level. Marc ""Moroes"" Bidoul helped me too, by making a few 3D models and textures.

[It took me] nine months [to make]. Not nine months of continuous work of course, but nine months with some days filled with dozens of hours of hard work. I worked on the nineteen test chambers for 3 to 4 months, followed by 2 months on the final level, and 2 months of testing, debugging, and polishing (interfaces, voices, commentaries, etc.). It took me a lot more time than I initially thought, mainly because I also had school exams and my actual job to do on the side.

In June 2008, I learned like everyone else that Valve was potentially working on what we thought would end up being an official prequel of Portal (Portal 2). It felt like I was the only person on Earth not entirely happy with this announcement. So, I decided to work twice as hard to release my version way before Valve ever could.

How did Portal: Prelude RTX come about?

Nicolas: Back in 2022, I was approached by David Driver-Gomm from ModDB.com, and Nyle Usmani from NVIDIA shortly before the release of Portal with RTX, and they had this idea of taking a popular fan-made Portal mod from the old days, and working on a remaster powered by the same RTX Remix technology [used to make Portal with RTX]. I originally declined due to my absence from the modding scene for the last ~10 years, but ultimately decided to get on board once I saw the technology in action and because it was the perfect opportunity to deliver the 15-year anniversary remaster that many gamers had requested over the years.

David: I was not a part of the original mod, but I played it when I was a kid, and as a big fan of Portal, I loved just having more Portal to play. Prelude told a very interesting story of a pre-GLaDOS Aperture that excited my creativity, and I remembered it fondly for many years. That’s why when it came to talking about what might be a project to uplift with a combination of Portal with RTX’s foundation and original work, Prelude immediately came to mind.


Nicolas: I wore and still wear many many hats during my modding experience/career. As mentioned earlier, you have to be mind-bogglingly adaptable when working on a mod as a super small team of amateurs. Probably too many to list and detail. However, a few of these are detailed as follows:

Environment Artist: Before you even start anything, you have to have a good idea of what the end result is supposed to look like. What ambience, scenery, visual decor, and soundscapes are going to play together. When we worked on ‘I Hate Mountains’, we had a gigantic bank of pictures and sounds to get us to imagine what the final result would look like as a team.

Level designer: Don’t get me wrong, this is a real job. Many people in the world actually studied to become good level designers, and know the ins and outs, patterns, and core concepts that make a good level good. That wasn’t my case, so iterating and having real players test the result has always been the crutch on which I relied most! Getting inspiration from other games, and real life locations has also been super influential in my process. This usually involves a ton of research and prototyping, like what we did on the ‘I Hate Mountains’ project:

This is usually done with the game’s level editor directly, roughly blocking out the layout, playtesting it ad-nauseum, and iterating on decor and environment from larger features to smaller details. I mostly used the Valve Hammer Editor for Source engine-based projects like Portal: Prelude RTX.

2D Artist: For Portal: Prelude RTX, I helped with texturing and more specifically remastering the existing 128x128/256x256/512x512 original textures into high-fidelity 1024x1024/2048x2048/4096x4096 multi-map textures supported by the RTX Remix toolkit.

The amount of work that a 4K multi-texture requires compared to a simple flat texture from the original game was surprising to me. Between the amount of details required on the albedo layer, the reflective map, roughness map, normal map, emissive map, opacity map, and more, it was definitely a challenge that forced me to learn and use more modern tools like Adobe Substance 3D and to have access to banks of high resolution pictures from real-life objects and textures.

Integrator: For most of the duration of the Portal: Prelude RTX project, I was the person in charge of doing the translation between the game’s old, low-resolution assets to the new, high-resolution assets. This process was done using the then [early] in-development tool from NVIDIA called RTX Remix. This allowed me to take virtual 3D screenshots of a level and all of its assets while in-game, load this capture in RTX Remix, and literally replace every single asset (texture, geometry, light, etc.) with a 10 or 100 times higher fidelity version using open-source 2D and 3D formats. 

I wouldn’t discount the fact that it also allows you to relight every single level with realistic path-traced lighting, which unlocked a ton of potential that old game engines could not provide back in the days. Several levels of Portal: Prelude have some limited amount of pre-baked lightmap changes to simulate dark vs. lit  environments, but the final result with RTX Remix is light-years ahead of what I could do back then. Having the opportunity to remaster these levels the way I had intended them to look like and behave back then was a nice cherry on the cake.

David: As I was primarily an asset creator, my workflow involved creating assets to spec to the original captured variants. As I was the main asset creator for the entire project’s history and operating on limited time, I tended to work straight from the captured meshes and then went to uplift them from there, to varying degrees. So:

Gather reference material on the original asset - 360 pictures usually taken in engine, most commonly in Garry’s Mod which has a total repository of all the Portal and Half-Life 2 assets we were using, which made it very easy for me to fly around the asset and get a close look at certain details
Load up the NVIDIA Omniverse version of Blender, which has USD import support and is my 3D modeling tool of choice
Import the USD of the asset captured by the RTX Remix runtime
Uplift the captured USD in Blender - model new geometry, bevel out edges, and so on. This process would be more or less involved depending on the complexity/importance of the original asset and how much time I had to assign to it. Some assets were practically modeled from scratch anyway, whereas some - like pipes - mostly just had all their edges beveled out so they were higher poly and smoother
UV unwrap the uplifted asset (usually my least favorite part, heh)
Bring the asset into Substance Painter so I can create high-quality PBR maps for the model and then work on adding additional details via texture/normal mapping
Export the textures, and then prep for ingestion into the game via RTX Remix
RTX Remix allowed us to inject these super high quality assets into environments and really go the extra step. Prelude is quite different from the original Portal in that it makes extensive use of added assets and different environments than just test chambers, leading to a lot of unique cases where new props were used in Prelude sourced from Half-Life 2 or Counter-Strike: Source, particularly in the last level of the game where you go face-to-face with scientists and their office-working environment. This presented a special opportunity to build an environment new from [those seen in] Portal with RTX. The RTX lighting certainly helped too, and that’s considering the original mod was already very competently lit via Source Engine methodology!


How did the GPU acceleration and AI-enabled features of GeForce RTX GPUs assist in development?

Nicolas: During the Portal: Prelude remaster, I mainly used two features that required intensive use of GPU-acceleration and AI-enabled features:

The RTX Remix tool itself is insanely powerful and almost comes across as magic to me. The ability to capture any part of a game, load it in a 3D tool and chip away at it as if this was being done using the original game’s level editor is insane. The amount of processing power that it requires to display and work in these levels in high-fidelity, path-traced dynamic lighting, with hundreds of high-poly 3D assets and 4K textures is also quite insane though. Having a powerful NVIDIA card to bear the brunt of the load was essential to my productivity.
Early on during the remaster process, we played with AI upscaling a lot. When staring down at the daunting task of remastering hundreds or thousands of textures manually from the original low-resolution flat textures to multi-map high-resolution textures, it was greatly helpful in cutting down on the early work and focusing more on hero assets that required a more hands-on treatment, like character/NPC models, and large predominant textures.
How will NVIDIA RTX Remix impact the future of mod development?

Nicolas: When I first saw Portal with RTX in action, I kept waiting for the shoe to drop. I was highly skeptical that a tool that anyone could use would be capable of such an incredibly high-fidelity remaster without having access to any of the original game’s assets or any way to modify the original games files. 

When I was able to get my hands on a pre-alpha early version of RTX Remix, I was honestly floored. I’m a software engineer in life, and I could not wrap my head around how such a thing could have even been built, let alone work exactly as I would have expected it to work. It really allowed me to launch an old game (Portal), click on a button in-game to take a capture of the world, load it into RTX Remix, click on a wall texture, replace it with literally anything from a cat meme picture to a super-realistic photo-realistic 8K texture, and literally see it pop up in-game in real time.

The fact that it provides a game-agnostic, proprietary format-agnostic, hands-on experience is something that could be a watershed moment in preserving legacy games and making sure that they can be experienced by a new generation of gamers in higher-fidelity without having to hope/wait for an officially sanctioned remaster or never see one because of a potentially defunct game studio.

David: RTX Remix opens up the graphical playing field dramatically for older games. A lot of people are happy to play older games with the graphics of the time, but it’s also a very common sub-genre of mod to try and uplift the fidelity of older games for a fresh visual experience on a replay. All of that used to have to be done either in-engine with the tools provided, or with some very challenging work injecting new graphical techniques into a game.

RTX Remix will do a lot of this work for modders in compatible titles, and as RTX becomes something of a norm as far as technology goes, it’ll be opened up to more and more people in the future. I also foresee that it will be a great addition to the processes for new mods and total conversions, as most asset creation pipelines today involve some level of PBR workflow that is then downgraded into an original engine. Overall it’ll simplify graphical remastering tremendously, and bring mods up a notch to be able to bat with professional titles.

Do you have any learnings you’d like to share with gamers or other mod developers about RTX Remix?

Nicolas: Yes, working with RTX Remix was a great experience, but with great power comes great responsibilities. The tool can be overwhelming because there is almost no limit to what you can do with it. You have to be well-organized,  and segment your project early if you want any chance of succeeding. It usually starts easy, but when you reach thousands of high-fidelity 2D and 3D assets, upon layers and layers of replacement, you better be organized especially if you’re working as a team.

With David, we made sure to have people dedicated to specific roles and specific sections of the remaster. David would create a “3D asset” replacement layer and work on replacing legacy objects like chairs and pipes while I was working on a “lighting” replacement layer that only contained changes to emissive textures and lights. We had many such replacement layers, similar to how a layer in Photoshop would work, like 2D assets, 3D assets, skyboxes, lighting, NPCs, signage, etc.

Additionally, having a well defined, agreed upon file organization strategy super early is of paramount importance so that files for each replacement layer are easy to find, and well segregated can help a ton when working as a team. Having a version control system to take care of versioning for you in addition to RTX Remix would be a must-have in my opinion.

Finally, you do have to think outside of the box sometimes. When I say there are no limits, there actually are, and these are the limits of what the original game provided. It can be hard to replace something that wasn’t there in the first game for example. Or it can be hard to work around a limitation of the first game that used a quirk of the game engine to make it work. One such example for us was working around pre-baked lighting in some levels of Portal: Prelude. You have to undo a lot of the workarounds that were made in the original game and replace them with better ones from RTX Remix, but it can require creative solutions and hacky workarounds to get to where you want to be. I think it’s part of the modding process though, and isn’t necessarily a bad thing. You have to be scrappy.

David: RTX Remix is great, but what we found on Portal: Prelude RTX, and what I believe is best for the tool overall, is that it works best when in tandem with other game tools. We used Hammer and level design to redesign parts of levels to function a little better in RTX; we made changes on the in-game side to facilitate better replacements by RTX Remix; and Portal: Prelude RTX received a lot more improvements, great and small, besides just the graphical overhaul. RTX Remix is a powerful arrow in any modder’s quiver, and best used alongside a varied toolset to push your mod to the next level. Depending on the task, it could very well be the only tool you really need, but it’s best as a collaborative item.

Thanks for speaking with us; Portal: Prelude RTX is an amazing game, and is truly spectacular on a GeForce RTX GPU. Follow Nicolas and David on Twitter to discover what they work on next.

By Andrew Burnes on July 18, 2023 | Featured StoriesGeForce RTX GPUsHardwareNVIDIA RTXNVIDIA RTX IOPortal with RTX
Rapid loading and smooth navigation through endless open worlds has long been a goal of gamers and developers alike. Even with the incredible performance of NVMe SSDs, this goal has remained out of reach. Modern game engines have exceeded the capability of traditional storage APIs; a new generation of Input/Output (IO) architecture is needed.

Enter NVIDIA RTX IO, enabling fast GPU-based loading and game asset decompression, massively accelerating IO performance compared to hard drives and traditional storage APIs. NVIDIA RTX IO leverages GPU decompression for smaller data packages, enabling faster load times and lower CPU utilization, allowing developers to create a new generation of games with massive, highly detailed worlds.  

NVIDIA RTX IO makes its debut alongside the free Portal: Prelude RTX mod today, and will also feature in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, launching July 26th.

How Does RTX IO Work?
NVIDIA RTX IO leverages the advanced architectures of GeForce GPUs to offload dozens of CPU cores’ worth of work to your GPU, enabling faster game loading, and opening the door to a new era of large, incredibly detailed open world games. RTX IO is based on GDeflate, an open GPU compression standard contributed by NVIDIA, which is utilized by both Microsoft’s DirectStorage and new Vulkan Extensions.   

Traditionally, data is sent from your disk drive to the CPU, decompressed through system memory, and sent to the GPU. This system is not designed with the capabilities of today’s Gen4 and Gen5 PCIe NVME SSDs in mind, using only a fraction of their capabilities. Bottlenecks from the CPU and System Memory, combined with bigger assets, limit the gains from newer SSDs, resulting in slower loading of assets, which can cause in-game texture pop-in, or longer loading times.  

Traditional Input/Output processes cause bottlenecks in today’s content-rich games

NVIDIA RTX IO dramatically increases IO bandwidth by letting compressed data be delivered to GPU memory with minimal staging in the CPU system memory. The GPU is utilized for decompression using GDeflate at high throughput, allowing the CPU to perform other tasks. As a result, object pop-in and stutter can be reduced, and high-quality textures can be streamed at incredible rates, so even if you’re speeding through a world, everything runs and looks great. In addition, with lossless compression, game download and install sizes can be reduced, allowing gamers to store more games on their SSD while also improving their performance.

NVIDIA RTX IO leverages GPU accelerated decompression for faster IO throughput

While RTX IO is supported on all modern DirectX 12 GPUs, it is designed to run on as many parallel cores in the GPU as possible, so in cases where the IO throughput is not the bottleneck, the more compute cores available, the more performant it is. Essentially, load times are fastest on more powerful GPUs and SSDs; specific speed ups will vary based on the game, scene, and your particular combination of GPU and disk drive.

In Portal: Prelude RTX, NVIDIA RTX IO is always on (you don’t need to toggle it in a menu), and it enables much faster texture load time, minimizing asset pop-in:


 

NVIDIA RTX Remix was used to bring Portal: Prelude RTX to life, and thanks to RTX IO and the use of Vulkan extensions, GPU decompression with GDeflate shrank Portal: Prelude RTX’s install size by 44%, enabling gorgeous 4K textures to be experienced losslessly with a minimal footprint. When the RTX Remix creator toolkit is released, every modder will be able to count on RTX IO to enable them to stay true to their artistic vision, while keeping within the file size restrictions of popular modding sites.

In Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, launching July 26th, NVIDIA RTX IO is used to quickly load high-quality textures and environments with a high level of detail when jumping between dimensions. With DirectStorage accelerated by RTX IO, and the use of a fast NVMe SSD, the integration results in very responsive texture streaming even at the highest settings.

Richard van der Laan, Senior Lead Programmer at Nixxes Software, explains: “To enable quick loading and instant transition between dimensions, the game needs to be able to load assets quickly. DirectStorage ensures quick loading times and GPU decompression is used at high graphics settings to stream assets in the background while playing.”  

RTX IO Supports DirectStorage & Vulkan
RTX IO is built on GDeflate, an open GPU compression standard contributed by NVIDIA to maximize adoption and compatibility, enabling each Independent Hardware Vendor (IHV) to add support in their drivers, and allowing developers to easily incorporate its technology across multiple platforms. RTX IO supports DirectX through DirectStorage, and Vulkan through Vulkan extensions.

NVIDIA RTX IO leverages open standard GPU compression standard supporting both DirectX & Vulkan  

On GeForce GTX and RTX PCs and laptops with Maxwell or newer architectures, the technology’s performance is further improved thanks to our Game Ready Drivers, and in titles with RTX IO integrations, the full capabilities of your GeForce RTX GPU are leveraged, giving you the definitive experience.
